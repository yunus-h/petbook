## Next steps:

The current PetBook is very simple. But there are some steps that can make PetBook even better. 

Adding detailed data on users, such as email, address, hobbies, and so on.

Adding detailed data on the pet, such as birthday, color, veterinarian, grooming salon, and so on.

PetBook would be great if there were pictures on user profiles, as well as on animal profiles. Also if all users in PetBook can connect with each other, and also see pictures and stories of their pets.
